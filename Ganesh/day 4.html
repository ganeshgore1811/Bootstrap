            A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence <br>
            that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do <br>
            not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, <br>
            in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.
